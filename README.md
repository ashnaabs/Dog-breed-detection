# Dog-breed-detection

This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to accurately classify and identify seven distinct dog breeds from a diverse set of images. By employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, meticulously designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, we achieve enhanced feature extraction and representation. The model undergoes extensive training on a balanced dataset, ensuring robust performance and generalization across the selected breeds. Additionally, advanced techniques such as data augmentation and regularization are integrated to mitigate overfitting and optimize model accuracy. This repository encapsulates the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training and evaluation, providing a comprehensive solution for the automated identification of dog breeds.
